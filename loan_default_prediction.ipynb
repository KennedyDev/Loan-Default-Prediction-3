    "We talked about the need of a conservative evaluation of the default rate. We must also keep in mind that there is a strong imbalance with the target category of loan repayment in the dataset, because about 6 out of 7 loans are repaid. Meaning that we could lend money all the time (always predicting that the borrower would repay) and be right about 85.71% of the time that the loan would be repaid, but that would mean that the model would not be profitable. Say we lend \\$1000 at 10% interest, we would expect a return of \\$100 on each loan. But if we run the experiment 7 times, we would earn \\$600 (6 x \\$100) and lose \\$1000 (the defaulter), we are left with a \\$400 loss. Hardly a profitable enterprise. The benchmark needs to encompass the weight of the defaulter and the optimization between the true positive rate (good borrowers) and the false positive rate (bad borrowers). This implies that we need to ensure a viable machine learning model and predict a higher percentage of potential defaulters in order to avoid lending to them. The benchmark must beat the 85.71% average loan repayment. Although “money is left on the table”, a conservative investor would prefer a steady return on her investment than suffer the 1 in 7 loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best metrics to evaluate our algorithm are the recall (true positive rate), the precision and the F1 score (a measure of the relation between the two previous metrics). We will achieve this by training our model on the training dataset and than trying to predict – based on the columns value – the good customers of the testing set. We can than measure if this is practical and realistic. Otherwise, error metric balancing will be handy in recalibrating the model because we know that there is an imbalance between the repaid loans and defaulted loan. The recall and precision are good metrics for measuring an imbalanced distribution of data points."
